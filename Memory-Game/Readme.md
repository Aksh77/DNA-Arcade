### How to Play

This is the modified version of the classic Memory Game.

* **A** (Adenine) pairs with **T** (Thymine)  and **C** (Cytosine) pairs with **G** (Guanine).
* Both the tiles should have the letters with the same colour in order to match.
* The Game is won when all the pairs are matched.
