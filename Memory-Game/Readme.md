### How to Play

This is the modified version of the classic Memory Game.
Instead of matching the tiles having the same object, you need to match the tiles having Complimentary Base pairs of DNA.

* **A** (Adenine) pairs with **T** (Thymine)  and **C** (Cytosine) pairs with **G** (Guanine).
* Both the tiles should have the letters with the same colour in order to match.
* The Game is won when all the pairs are matched.


### To-Do

* Calculate Time Elapsed
* Count Number of moves
